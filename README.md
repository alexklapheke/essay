# Executive Summary

*Note: The accompanying [slide deck](https://github.com/alexklapheke/essay/blob/master/presentation/presentation.pdf) contains a more detailed summary of the project.*

The problem of scoring essays by computer is decades old, and of increasing relevance (and controversy) as test providers use these in lieu of human readers. In this project, I use a dual-input RNN to build a simple essay scorer, which achieves 62% accuracy against a 36% baseline. A more complex scorer could achieve greater accuracy by incorporating independent spelling and grammar checks, or checking prompt relevance using word-vector similarity.
